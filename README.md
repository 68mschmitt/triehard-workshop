# TrieHard Workshop

**A self-paced learning journey for building text processing tools in C**

---

## What Is This?

This repository contains structured learning paths for software engineers who want to build practical, production-quality tools while deepening their systems programming skills.

Each course guides you through building a complete project from scratch, teaching concepts as you need them rather than front-loading theory.

## Available Courses

| Course | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [Course 1: Word Library Engine](./course-01-word-library-engine/) | Build a fast, extensible word library with hash sets, tries, and BK-trees | ✅ Complete |

## Philosophy

- **Learn by building** - Every concept connects to working code
- **Practical over academic** - Focus on what you'll actually use
- **Fun over exhaustive** - Keep momentum, go deeper later if needed
- **Production quality** - Tests, benchmarks, memory safety from the start

---

## Who Is This For?

Software engineers who:
- Want hands-on practice with C and data structures
- Prefer building real tools over toy examples
- Learn best by doing, with theory as needed
- Are preparing for systems programming work
